# Keycloak 2FA SMS Authenticator

Keycloak Authentication Provider implementation to get a 2nd-factor authentication with a OTP/code/token send via SMS with a configurable HTTPS API. It should be possible to interact with most SMS providers. Issues and pull requests to support more SMS providers are welcome.

This is a fork of a great demo implementation by [@dasniko](https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator), and also takes huge chunks of code from the original authenticator provider [documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#_auth_spi) and [example](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/examples/providers/authenticator) from Keycloak itself.

## Building

1. Clone this repository
1. Install Apache Maven
1. Change into the cloned directory and run
   ```shell
   mvn package
   ```
   A file `target/netzbegruenung.keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator.jar` should be created.

## Installing
1. Go to https://github.com/netzbegruenung/keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator/releases and download
   the latest .jar file.
1. Copy the created jar file into the `providers` directory of your Keycloak:
   ```shell
   cp netzbegruenung.keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator.jar /path/to/keycloak/providers
   ```
1. Run the `build` command and restart Keycloak:
   ```shell
   /path/to/keycloak/bin/kc.sh build [your-additional-flags]
   systemctl restart keycloak.service
   ```

## Usage
1. Add a new execution to the 2FA flow of your Browser flow, choose "SMS Authentication (2FA)".
1. Make sure that you name it "sms-2fa". This is currently a hack that will hopefully be fixed. Additional executions with other names can be added. But this first execution will be used for the confirmation SMS when setting up a new phone number.
1. Go into the config of the execution and configure the plugin so that it works with the API of your SMS proivder.
